# Engineering Project Lecture

## In this course, a documentation has been prepared that describes the whole process from the instantiation of a project to the step just before it. (In Turkish)

### As a group, our project is a drone designed to prevent forest fires, which are taking place a lot in our country. Our drone can fly in areas where fire may occur and detect fire before the fire grows. In this way, the pre-detected fire can be extinguished before it grows.
